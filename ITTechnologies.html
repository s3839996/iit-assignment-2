                <h2 id="yeet1"><b>SMALL COMPUTING DEVICES</b></h2>
                <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
                <p> A big impact was in 2008 when Steve jobs at Apple introduced the first smartphone called the ‘’iPhone’ Which revolutionised the way we use small portable computing devices. It was pretty much a mobile phone, internet Browser, music players, and messaging service all in one small compact device. This technology has allowed many people to move to do most technology-based activities on either big computers and laptops to do them on a portable mobile or tablet. The introduction of this phone and other small computing devices is not engrained in society, showing a whole new generation of people growing up without even experiencing or using a personnel computer.   </p>
                <p> Currently, the Raspberry Pi has to ability to be used for all sorts of different purposes but at only one inexpensive cost. Such uses include its ability to be set up as a home web or file server, a Wi-Fi extender, or a small PC for the home theater due to its ability to output video at Full HD(1920 x 1080p). Raspberry pie also provides developers and programmers with a small and inexpensive Linux box to play around with but can also be used for serious work, As well as the ability to run Linux the raspberry pi also supports Android and Windows to a certain extent.  </p>
                <p> Printers and large commercial photocopiers also contain small computing devices to make the user experience and device functionality better. Touch screen printers often have a small operating system in which the user can interact with to perform certain functions such as adjusting layout and print setting, connecting to a wireless network, or visually displaying a printer's ink level. The complexity increases as we move on to large commercial and office printers which have the ability for users to login with their own credentials and use their assigned print credit and often also have the ability to connect to multiple networks which require a microcomputer to regulate network traffic, users and print requests.  </p>
                <p> The development in small computing devices is also playing a more significant role in the automotive industry such as the cars we drive. It has the ability to improve fuel efficiency, power, and the driver's overall experience when it comes to its multimedia and climate control ability. Towards the future, it has the potential to control aspects in a car such as maintenance and self-driving.  </p>
                <p> Raspberry Pi also as a lot of Potential In many developing nations this is due to its lost cost and minimal power combined with its powerful computing power and its ability to be used as a multimedia device. This could also be due to the fact that computer equipment may not be readily available as therein is many developed nations. Even if there available the prices for normal computer equipment would likely be un affordance for the average person. </p>

                <p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT</u></p>
                <p>The revolution in small computing devices has seen professional artists and video editors move from computers to laptops. This is due to pencil and touch support on tablets for arias and the fast and efficient process on tablets for movie editors. </p>
                <p>Mobile computing also allowed people to connect from a distance in however fashion like. Whether it is via video call using something like FaceTime. Or plain voice call. When it comes to texting it is no longer just plain text we can now share our emotions through emojis or share videos and photos till our heart's content.</p>
                <p>In the coming months, we will likely see more job positions open up for mobile computing relent fields such as iOS, Android, and web technologies positions. We will see languages such as Swift be taught a mainstream subject in our schools and universities. </p>
                <p>Small computing is also prevalent in the cars we drive. These are known as ECU (Engine control unit) or PTM (Power train module ). These computers control vital comments of your car such as how much fuel is sent through the fuel injectors or controlling the ABS (Anti-Lock braking system) system which is a vital safety system along with the deployment for airbags. These computers process data by receiving data from various sensors placed through the engine and car. A few examples are MAF (mass airflow sensor) which detects how much air is getting sucked, and VSS (vehicle speed sensor) which is used to tell the computer how fast the vehicle is going.</p>
                <p>Arduino is a company that produces microcontroller kits. These can be programmed using common programming languages such as Java, C and C++ hence being a really useful education tool helping students from primary school to University to understand programming and robotics. Again, their cost means they can reach a wide range of audiences which further engrains the idea of micro computing amongst students and developers.  </p>

                <p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
                <p>Some daily computing tasks that are repetitive are being taken over by these small computing devices. This effect is already seen at self-service checkouts at some big supermarket chains around the world. Over the past few years, we have seen the reduction of supermarket checkout people instead we now have the option of self-serve. This is largely due to the small computing devices which can be specially designed and programmed to perform a certain task such as running the specifically built supermarket software.</p>
                <p>Another aspect that these small computing devices have impacted me is the way we sign in and sign out of work is. Some workplaces now utilise a small touch screen computer running a specific working hours tracker which allows users / employees to sign in/out using a pin or for some workplaces, it also has the ability for biometric verification. This will make the roster/employee attendance for both the employee and employer cause gone of the days are of manual entering the start and end date on a piece of paper.</p>

                <h2 id="yeet2"><b>CLOUD COMPUTING</b></h2>
                <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
                <p> Cloud computing is used to describe various remote operations but is often the practice of utilising remote servers to store data, process it, manage it. This provides a central source of data is instead of using a local or personnel computer. Even though the term cloud computing is being thrown around more often these the fact is its been used in a much smaller scale some time ago. Even though cloud computing has been used for while it was only on a more smaller scale. But recently it has gained traction among both tech enthusiasts and other people from all walks of life. This is because its starting to play a major role in our day to day lives including impacting how we Work, Play, Learn and socialise. </p>
                <p> The future of cloud computing is pretty clear and we are seeing it take a bigger role in particular work palaces activities. It is very possible in the future with even smaller bunnies that they move away from buying computer towers and servers and instead moves to a cloud layout knows as DaaS (Desktop as a service) as a method of deploying workstations to employers. This would mean the client-side will only have minimal bare bonds such as keyboard mouse and screen which is used to connect to a remote centralised server. Of course, this would require fast internet bandwidth accompanied with low latency for a real time experience. </p>
                <p> We have seen the big tech giants in America quickly expanding the network infrastructure to provide the cloud infrastructure as a service to its customers. We have seen Microsoft rapidly moving away from Windows being its main source to revenue to Microsoft Azure (its cloud computing server) playing a bigger part in the its revenue. Now Microsoft use's its Windows platform to leverage its users to use Microsoft pay as you go cloud services. </p>
                <p> Also in the current state, we have utilised cloud machine learning to defend the ever-growing threat of the Covid 19 pandemic with the ability to produce and predict graphs and other data to help predict future cases and help with flattening the curve </p>
                <p> Cloud computing has also been the foundation of modern multiplier games. Where all users in a certain match will connect to one centralised server. On the other hand, this can assist game developers since a Pay as you go scheme can easily scale of the compatibility of a server has required, hence saving time and money </p>
                <p> In the next couple of years, we will definitely see an increase in the developments of self driving cars. The foundation is slowly being layed out the deployment of 5G network across Australia and other countries will which allow a low latency and real time connection between self driving cars and the central servers. In addition to Offloading machine learning to cloud as increased a company's ability to scale up as they need. Speeding up the process to learn and dignity patters, objects, pedestrians, and other road hazards while saving money at the same time. </p>

                <p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT</u></p>
                <p>Cloud will affect business and people from all walks of life. Cloud computing services providers such as Amazon web services and Microsoft azure provide services for satisfying needs for business and personal use weather its a small website to large a scale database or VPS. The use of cloud computing reduces the need for the Business to setup and maintain their own servers. Instead of slowing to use the method Pay as You go where the user only pays for what they use whether this is the price per gigabyte or price per 1000 requests. This allows a business to focus on expanding their products and services without there computing hardware resources hindering their expansion</p>
                <p>Cloud computing allows the process of streaming education. A cloud solution like a web app for example Canvas, This solution provides a single point of contact for assignment submissions, student-teacher communication, watching record lessons, and announcements. This has single handily revolutionised how we learn and teach. This technology has especially become very used during the 2020 CVOID 19 pandemic crisis where schools and universities had to suspend face to face learning and switch to online classes.</p>
                <p>Even though cloud computing may have many positives impact on society and are way they are many negative social impacts and disadvantages. As a general note when a business moves there IT infrastructure and services to the cloud the business often as to automaticity by nature has relinquish some control and privacy to the Cloud service providers. This is often known has this in the cloud where mass amounts of consumer data its stored in one centralised service where it could be analysed and used for multiple purposes including sometimes malicious and nefarious purposes.</p>
                <p>OF course with all this expansion will see an increase in demand of General IT technician and positions relating to clouding computing such as hardware and software engineers, architect. There will be many IT positions made redundant where a group of technicians may manage an individual's boniness Server setup etc. But on the bridge side the skill and experience this technician may be utilised by re implying them in big data centers.</p>

                <p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
                <p>Cloud computing has already played a major part in my interaction with technology. Cloud computing as assisted in the process of managing, storing and processing data. A service that is often using it iCloud. So rather than me saving a document locally it uploads to remote iCloud severs. Which means I can access this via any device, this may be a mobile, a computer or through the internet browser. </p>
                <p>The world of cloud computing has also impacted the way I and other students learn and work. An example of this is a remote virtual desktop. At my school, we can easily access the school computers in a desktop view in the comfort of our own homes. I use a client app on my local computer to connect a virtual server located at school. This feature provides a need not to copy and transfer files via email etc cause our data can be access where there is an internet connection. Also RMIT’s use of Canvas providers a centralised place of communication with students and teachers and a place to actress past recording of lecturers and practices </p>
                <p>Cloud computing also increased my productivity when working in groups to use features such as live calibration. Web apps such as Google docs allows multiple people to simultaneously edit and work on the same document while providing real-time updates to the document. So I can see exactly and where my group members are typing in the word document. Also, apps like Microsoft teams provide an excellent way for me to communicate with other group members since it provides features such as sharing documents and files and also has to ability to easily record group meetings</p>

                <h2 id="yeet3"><b>CYBERSECURITY</b></h2>
                <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
                <p>Our world as we know it has started to become more and more dependent on technology over the last several decades. And throughout this time, technology has evolved in ways that were completely unimaginable before, and it will only continue to evolve at a staggering rate, particularly over the next few decades. Due to our increased reliance of these technologies, such as computer systems and networks, we need to ensure that these devices are protected from potential damage to their software, hardware and other electronic parts. </p>
                <p>This is where the term “Cybersecurity” comes into play, which is referring to the practices that are in place to ensure the protection and safety of these electronic systems and networks. This protection can be done through tools, programs, software, and a range of other technologies; depending on what you’re trying to protect (whether it be a network, your data, your identity / personal information, or your personal devices). Some examples of current Cybersecurity tools include antivirus software, firewalls, encryption tools, and monitoring / scanning tools for networks. </p>
                <p>Current developments in Cybersecurity seem to mainly be involving Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and as such, this technology could also be considered the “state of the art” of Cybersecurity. The way that this technology is utilised in Cybersecurity is by using machine learning to identify common patterns of potential threats and respond to them as soon as they’re detected on a system. </p>
                <p>An early stage using machine learning in cybersecurity is our common Antivirus software, which uses a form of artificial intelligence known as “signature analysis” (which relies on a list of attributes of past threats to then identify new ones). This method can be problematic as this only able to identify past and current threats, and not new ones whose attributes are completely unknown. So rather than using “signature analysis”, another mechanism known as “behavioural analysis” can be used, which is where the actions of the files are examined, rather than judging them only based on their signature or appearance. However, just like “signature analysis”, this method can also have severe problems / bypasses, as it can be fooled by malware that cannot be detected until runtime. So, what other alternatives are there? Well, there is a third AI mechanism, called “anomaly detection”. Unlike the other two mechanisms, this one takes note of the activity patterns of potential threats, and from this it sets a baseline to which other threats can be compared to. The only downside to this mechanism is that it can quite often send out a false positive, but it's safer to block all potential threats (and have a few false positives), rather than letting through the threats in the first place. And these false positives can often be “whitelisted” by the user, which tells the mechanism that this program / file is safe, and it should ignore it in the future. Nowadays, most antivirus software's utilise many (if not all) of these AI mechanisms. </p>
                <p>So, what does the future hold for AI and cybersecurity? First off, these “traditional” AI methods will not be sufficient enough to handle threats that we will soon have to face, so a much more advanced form of AI will be required. This is where “Machine Learning” is introduced, which is still a very new technology in itself. Machine Learning allows for rapid analysis of large amounts of data, allowing it to uncover “hidden patterns” without having to even learn about the attributes of the threats and then make comparisons. This will allow our threat detection systems to be more efficient and ensure the safety or more systems at the same time. Additionally, other AI technologies such as deep learning and neural networks are also starting to be investigated for potential cybersecurity implementations, so expect to see these in the future. </p>

                <p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</u></p>
                <p>Despite some of the fallbacks of current cybersecurity technologies, these technologies are still providing somewhat suitable protection for our computer systems and networks. These security measures will mostly affect businesses, with both big and small business being at equal risk if a potential cyber-attack. According to the Cyber Security Breaches Survey, ‘nearly half (43 per cent) of all UK businesses had reported cyber security breaches or attacks in the last 12 months’. This re-enforces the importance that businesses all implement cybersecurity measures as to ensure the safety of their files, software, systems, websites, and potentially other assets. Due to this high demand of security requested by businesses, the field of Cybersecurity is said grow exponentially, and according to the ‘U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics’, this demand will grow by more than 32% from 2018-2022, with tens of thousands of jobs set to be created. In terms of the changes in Cybersecurity we can expect to see in the near future, there may be a transition away from traditional AI mechanisms, and standard will be set to use more advanced algorithms such as previously mentioned Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. </p>

                <p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
                <p>Cybersecurity is something that can have an effect in every person's life, even though they may not think so. Practically everyone that uses some form technology (whether it be a phone, email, Wi-Fi, computer, or even a credit card) is a risk to some form of attack or threat. Unfortunately, a lot of people that use these everyday items are completely unaware of the potential threats involved, and because they aren’t “technologically educated” (a lot of people aren’t), they will easily fail to spot these threats. An example of this could be spam/phishing emails, and that most of the people who fall for these scams are older / less technology educated people. In terms of how this would affect me (and most of those around my age), we have a lot more experience with using computers on a daily basis, and generally don’t fall for these threats, and are often the “techies” amongst our families and friends. But even we aren’t completely immune to these threats, what may seem as a harmless file may in fact be malware which could corrupt / steal our personal information. So, if Cybersecurity advances and evolves, it will help to ensure that the elderly and non-tech comfortable people will be able to use our technology with ease, as well as feeling 100% safe when using it. </p>

                <h2 id="yeet4"><b>DATA ANALYTICS</b></h2>
                <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
                <p>Analytics combines together concept and experience for discovering and sharing data-driven perspectives that allow an organization's management, partners and other executives to make more educated decisions. Analysis relates to splitting a whole into its different components for review. Techniques in data analytics can disclose patterns and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of knowledge. It knowledge will then be used to improve systems to boost a company or system's overall performance. Data analysis is a process in which raw data is obtained and converted into information that is helpful for user decision making. To answer questions, test hypotheses or refute theories, data are collected and analyzed and also Data analytics is essential because it lets businesses maximize their efficiency. Implementing that into the corporate plan ensures that companies can effectively save expenses by finding most effective ways to conduct business and processing vast volumes of knowledge. A company should also utilize data mining to make smart strategic choices to understand the patterns to satisfaction of consumers that may contribute to new products or services. Experienced data analysts are looking at their job in a wider way, inside their organization, and take into consideration different external influences. Hence a Data Analyst analyses data and translates it into information that can provide opportunities to enhance a market and thereby influence management decisions. Data Analysts collect information from multiple sources and analyse patterns and developments. If the data is gathered and analyses, the data analyst must communicate back to the stakeholder of business / relevant authority what was observed in a thorough analysis. Companies in all sectors depend on data to make important business decisions , what new goods to build, new markets to reach, new offerings to make and new (or existing) consumers to attract. Data analytics detect inefficiencies and other market problems which need to observed.In the role of the data analyst, they are developed and maintained data structures and repositories, this involves correcting computer coding mistakes and other code related issues. By using statistical tools, they are able to analyse data sets, with special attention to trends and patterns that may be useful for diagnostic and predictive analytical efforts. Normally they work with designers, developers, and corporate members to find potential for process enhancements, propose modifications to the framework and build governance policies by using data. For dealing with those observations as mentioned above , There should be some Professional capabilities or developments in database languages including SQL, R, or Python; spreadsheet applications including Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets; and data analysis apps like Tableau or Qlik. Mathematical and statistical qualifications are often useful in helping to capture, calculate, coordinate and interpret data. Thus, the development of machine learning techniques, large data sets and cheap computational resources in many industries has allowed the use of Data analytics. Data sets processing is important in the activation of these techniques. Hence it allows businesses to draw significant results from different and varied sources of data. </p>

                <p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</u></p>
                <p>It was never a better time for data to hit importance. There is an growing amount of data available, computational capacity is rising, and statistical methods and the so-called data science are being rapidly advanced. Many technical and business related problems make acknowledging the value of the data and knowing it’s a constant issue. Data has not only grown in volume, however; it has also achieved considerable complexity and richness. We reached a modern age in which the field of science has been profoundly linked to the physical environment. Data is created by everything from cameras and traffic sensors to heart rate monitors, allowing for further insight into human activity and "stuff". So nowadays police officers aren’t need to stand on roads and whistling here and there. Because these cameras and traffic sensors do that part and store every data which those devices were allocating in 24/7.By refer those data government can implement legal actions toward transgressors. As a case like this leads to loosing or replacing the jobs of people. Moreover, Data scientists will be allowed to conduct "large data expeditions" where there is no other specific goal but to search the data for previously unknown interest. For instance, data scientists at a Chinese shipping service provider discovered that, as they offered their conventional ship classification services, they were gathering useful data that had incredible potential in other fields. Through applying the right methodology to these results, ship operators were able to minimize machinery failures and maintenance costs through 10%. By providing this value-added service to consumers, this helped the company to rapidly raise its market share by 20%. Here, Data analytics positively affected to the service provider. Likewise, from the way how handling data will effect in different ways. </p>

                <p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
                <p>Many people assumed that data was used primarily for operations in serious industry. It is used every day to improve communications, enhance protection and boost shipping logistics' cost effectiveness. In my personal life Data plays a significant part, because my Ideal job is also to become Data analyst. Actually I use Microsoft excel to store the payments , Invoices and incomes from my job. So it helps me to clearly get an idea about the moments of my expenditures. I noticed something in Google Maps in my mobile device, that is the directions given are still becoming better and more accurate, with choices for cycling and, in certain situations, for public transport. More evolved smart cities will also have the shortest intermodal transit paths, from point A to point B. I think for this improvement data is highly affected. Furthermore my parents used to use fitness tracker when they are doing their trainings. Today exercise trackers and smartphones are now helping people live a more healthy life, eat better and regulate their weight so that is just the start. These systems are now measuring heart rate, sleep cycles, and other physiological signs and can be used to support certain healthcare purposes and diagnosis. The best treatment is avoidance, and the data science would help us to keep in touch with our health care at any time. Like this data analytics affected to our day to day life secretly, many people don’t know about it and they don’t consider much about data analytics. They might not even realise this, but they probably use data analytics almost daily. </p>
