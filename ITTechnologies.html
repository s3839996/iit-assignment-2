      <h2 id="yeet3"><b>CYBERSECURITY</b></h2>
	  <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
      <p>Our world as we know it has started to become more and more dependent on technology over the last several decades. And throughout this time, technology has evolved in ways that were completely unimaginable before, and it will only continue to evolve at a staggering rate, particularly over the next few decades. Due to our increased reliance of these technologies, such as computer systems and networks, we need to ensure that these devices are protected from potential damage to their software, hardware and other electronic parts.  </p>
	<p>This is where the term “Cybersecurity” comes into play, which is referring to the practices that are in place to ensure the protection and safety of these electronic systems and networks. This protection can be done through tools, programs, software, and a range of other technologies; depending on what you’re trying to protect (whether it be a network, your data, your identity / personal information, or your personal devices). Some examples of current Cybersecurity tools include antivirus software, firewalls, encryption tools, and monitoring / scanning tools for networks.  </p>
<p>Current developments in Cybersecurity seem to mainly be involving Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and as such, this technology could also be considered the “state of the art” of Cybersecurity. The way that this technology is utilised in Cybersecurity is by using machine learning to identify common patterns of potential threats and respond to them as soon as they’re detected on a system.  </p>
<p>An early stage using machine learning in cybersecurity is our common Antivirus software, which uses a form of artificial intelligence known as “signature analysis” (which relies on a list of attributes of past threats to then identify new ones). This method can be problematic as this only able to identify past and current threats, and not new ones whose attributes are completely unknown. So rather than using “signature analysis”, another mechanism known as “behavioural analysis” can be used, which is where the actions of the files are examined, rather than judging them only based on their signature or appearance. However, just like “signature analysis”, this method can also have severe problems / bypasses, as it can be fooled by malware that cannot be detected until runtime. So, what other alternatives are there? Well, there is a third AI mechanism, called “anomaly detection”. Unlike the other two mechanisms, this one takes note of the activity patterns of potential threats, and from this it sets a baseline to which other threats can be compared to. The only downside to this mechanism is that it can quite often send out a false positive, but it's safer to block all potential threats (and have a few false positives), rather than letting through the threats in the first place. And these false positives can often be “whitelisted” by the user, which tells the mechanism that this program / file is safe, and it should ignore it in the future. Nowadays, most antivirus software's utilise many (if not all) of these AI mechanisms.  </p>
<p>So, what does the future hold for AI and cybersecurity? First off, these “traditional” AI methods will not be sufficient enough to handle threats that we will soon have to face, so a much more advanced form of AI will be required. This is where “Machine Learning” is introduced, which is still a very new technology in itself. Machine Learning allows for rapid analysis of large amounts of data, allowing it to uncover “hidden patterns” without having to even learn about the attributes of the threats and then make comparisons. This will allow our threat detection systems to be more efficient and ensure the safety or more systems at the same time. Additionally, other AI technologies such as deep learning and neural networks are also starting to be investigated for potential cybersecurity implementations, so expect to see these in the future.  </p>

<p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</u></p>
<p>Despite some of the fallbacks of current cybersecurity technologies, these technologies are still providing somewhat suitable protection for our computer systems and networks. These security measures will mostly affect businesses, with both big and small business being at equal risk if a potential cyber-attack. According to the Cyber Security Breaches Survey, ‘nearly half (43 per cent) of all UK businesses had reported cyber security breaches or attacks in the last 12 months’. This re-enforces the importance that businesses all implement cybersecurity measures as to ensure the safety of their files, software, systems, websites, and potentially other assets. Due to this high demand of security requested by businesses, the field of Cybersecurity is said grow exponentially, and according to the ‘U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics’, this demand will grow by more than 32% from 2018-2022, with tens of thousands of jobs set to be created. In terms of the changes in Cybersecurity we can expect to see in the near future, there may be a transition away from traditional AI mechanisms, and standard will be set to use more advanced algorithms such as previously mentioned Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks.  </p>

<p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
<p>Cybersecurity is something that can have an effect in every person's life, even though they may not think so. Practically everyone that uses some form technology (whether it be a phone, email, Wi-Fi, computer, or even a credit card) is a risk to some form of attack or threat. Unfortunately, a lot of people that use these everyday items are completely unaware of the potential threats involved, and because they aren’t “technologically educated” (a lot of people aren’t), they will easily fail to spot these threats. An example of this could be spam/phishing emails, and that most of the people who fall for these scams are older / less technology educated people. In terms of how this would affect me (and most of those around my age), we have a lot more experience with using computers on a daily basis, and generally don’t fall for these threats, and are often the “techies” amongst our families and friends. But even we aren’t completely immune to these threats, what may seem as a harmless file may in fact be malware which could corrupt / steal our personal information. So, if Cybersecurity advances and evolves, it will help to ensure that the elderly and non-tech comfortable people will be able to use our technology with ease, as well as feeling 100% safe when using it.  </p>

      <h2 id="yeet4"><b>DATA ANALYTICS</b></h2>
	  <p><u>WHAT DOES IT DO?</u></p>
      <p>Analytics combines together concept and experience for discovering and sharing data-driven perspectives that allow an organization's management, partners and other executives to make more educated decisions. Analysis relates to splitting a whole into its different components for review. Techniques in data analytics can disclose patterns and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of knowledge. It knowledge will then be used to improve systems to boost a company or system's overall performance. Data analysis is a process in which raw data is obtained and converted into information that is helpful for user decision making. To answer questions, test hypotheses or refute theories, data are collected and analyzed and also Data analytics is essential because it lets businesses maximize their efficiency. Implementing that into the corporate plan ensures that companies can effectively save expenses by finding most effective ways to conduct business and processing vast volumes of knowledge. A company should also utilize data mining to make smart strategic choices to  understand the patterns to satisfaction of consumers that may contribute to new products or services. Experienced data analysts are looking at their job in a wider way, inside their organization, and take into consideration different external influences. Hence a Data Analyst analyses data and translates it into information that can provide opportunities to enhance a market and thereby influence management decisions. Data Analysts collect information from multiple sources and analyse patterns and developments. If the data is gathered and analyses, the data analyst must communicate back to the stakeholder of business / relevant authority what was observed in a thorough analysis. Companies in all sectors depend on data to make important business decisions , what new goods to build, new markets to reach, new offerings to make and new (or existing) consumers to attract. Data analytics detect inefficiencies and other market problems which need to observed.In the role of the data analyst, they are developed and maintained data structures and repositories, this involves correcting computer coding mistakes and other code related issues. By using statistical tools, they are able to analyse data sets, with special attention to trends and patterns that may be useful for diagnostic and predictive analytical efforts. Normally they work with designers, developers, and corporate members to find potential for process enhancements, propose modifications to the framework and build governance policies by using data. For dealing with those observations as mentioned above , There should be some Professional capabilities or developments in database languages including SQL, R, or Python; spreadsheet applications including Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets; and data analysis apps like Tableau or Qlik. Mathematical and statistical qualifications are often useful in helping to capture, calculate, coordinate and interpret data. Thus, the development of machine learning techniques, large data sets and cheap computational resources in many industries has allowed the use of Data analytics. Data sets processing is important in the activation of these techniques. Hence it allows businesses to draw significant results from different and varied sources of data. </p>
	  
	  <p><u>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</u></p>
<p>It was never a better time for data to hit importance. There is an growing amount of data available, computational capacity is rising, and statistical methods and the so-called data science are being rapidly advanced. Many technical and business related problems make acknowledging the value of the data and knowing it’s  a constant issue. Data has not only grown in volume, however; it has also achieved considerable complexity and richness. We reached a modern age in which the field of science has been profoundly linked to the physical environment. Data is created by everything from cameras and traffic sensors to heart rate monitors, allowing for further insight into human activity and "stuff". So nowadays police officers aren’t need to stand on roads and whistling here and there. Because  these cameras and traffic sensors do that part and store every data which those devices were allocating in 24/7.By refer those data government can implement legal actions toward transgressors. As a case like this leads to loosing or replacing the jobs of people. Moreover, Data scientists will be allowed to conduct "large data expeditions" where there is no other specific goal but to search the data for previously unknown interest. For instance, data scientists at a Chinese shipping service provider discovered that, as they offered their conventional ship classification services, they were gathering useful data that had incredible potential in other fields. Through applying the right methodology to these results, ship operators were able to minimize machinery failures and maintenance costs through 10%. By providing this value-added service to consumers, this helped the company to rapidly raise its market share by 20%. Here, Data analytics  positively affected to the service provider. Likewise, from the way how handling data will effect in different ways. </p>

<p><u>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</u></p>
<p>Many people assumed that  data was used primarily for operations in serious industry. It is used every day to improve communications, enhance protection and boost shipping logistics' cost effectiveness. In my personal life Data plays a significant part, because my Ideal job is also to become Data analyst. Actually I use Microsoft excel to store the payments , Invoices and incomes from my job. So it helps me to clearly get an idea about the moments of my expenditures.  I noticed something  in Google Maps in my mobile device, that is the directions given are still becoming better and more accurate, with choices for cycling and, in certain situations, for public transport. More evolved smart cities will also have the shortest intermodal transit paths, from point A to point B. I think for this improvement data is highly affected. Furthermore my parents used to use fitness tracker when they are doing their trainings. Today exercise trackers and smartphones are now helping people live a more healthy life, eat better and regulate their weight so that is just the start. These systems are now measuring heart rate, sleep cycles, and other physiological signs and can be used to support certain healthcare purposes and diagnosis. The best treatment is avoidance, and the data science would help us to keep in touch with our health care at any time. Like this data analytics affected to our day to day life secretly, many people don’t know about it and they don’t consider much about data analytics. They might not even realise this, but they probably use data analytics almost daily. </p>
