                <h2><b>WHAT KIND OF WORK IS DONE BY THE IT PROFESSIONAL?</b></h2>
                <li>Network administration - It is the responsibility of IT professionals to support the day to day activities of a computer network. Their role is to ensure network systems keep communication and information properly.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Security administration - IT experts play a critical role in software design to deter cyber-attacks from the people with criminal intents on the internet. And their main goal is preventing the internet become a fertile field for their unlawful acts.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Database analyst - To coordinate, monitor and store data, IT specialists use special tools. It covers accounting reports, shipping records, sales orders, payroll records, and operating expenses -etc. Database administrators make this information accessible to users and create security protocols that prevent unauthorized access to the database.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cloud computing - Moving data storage to the cloud means more than just buying a few megabytes of online space. It is not as straightforward as moving an in-house machine to an outsource. Moving to the cloud involves assessing an organization's needs, and then preparing and developing the installation. So, this is the task which must done by cloud computing professionals.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Software developers / Engineers - In a machine, a software system runs everything you do, and someone has got to write the code for that system. That is a software developer's work. The software engineer checks and loads the programs on to the machines after a software developer has written the codes and developed a program. These developers use their experience of hardware machines and software codes to execute the systems to make them convenient for non-IT workers to use.</li>
                <br>

                <h2><b>WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE DOES THE IT PROFESSIONAL INTERACT WITH?</b></h2>
                <li>The IT environment extends through all aspects of the planet today. Focusing exclusively on technologies and knowledge lacks the wider reach IT practitioners seek to practice and interact with other practitioners. Governance, Private sector and society are just a few of the environmental elements of the IT work. IT professionals are mainly interacting with their stakeholders because most of the time, the task which IT professional must accomplish is required by their clients or stakeholders so those clients might be the government or a private company or a single investor. As mentioned above, each kind of IT professional encounter with their own career tasks.</li>
                <br>
                <li>There is another hidden party which IT professional interact with. If any, IT workers who stay for a long time in a job without learning new IT skills and training, then they are end up with who knows only one programming language, one database resource, one operating system or one technique. So, in this case some IT professionals interact with some other IT experts who can teach recent resources that peregrinate in current IT world.</li>
                <br>

                <h2><b>WHERE DOES THE IT PROFESSIONAL SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME?</b></h2>
                <li>From the videos which we referred and according to recent study from the Bureau of Labour Statistics, more than half of you (53%) will consider just 10 hours or less a week to enjoy recreational activities. In fact, 43% of the IT professionals we surveyed spend 40 to 60 hours per week at work, higher than the national average of 34 hours. So, it’s clearly demonstrated that IT professionals are mostly spending time in their workplace and some of those professionals (Security administration, Network administration and Cloud computing etc.) might be able to available in 24/7. Especially Security administration should be available at any time when there is a collapse of a system. Hence these types of specialists mostly work from their home or their own space.</li>
                <br>

                <h2><b>WHAT ASPECTS OF THEIR POSITION IS MOST CHALLENGING?</b></h2>
                <li>Right now, technology is innovating at a staggering rate. As soon as one tool or piece of software appears, something new seems to be emerging that will make it outdated. Since this rapid technology development IT professionals have to spend a considerable time towards update their knowledge. It’s bit challenging when they are working with Industry. And, Data analysts are facing unstructured data problems in these days. Unstructured data is rising faster than structured data. Being a fairly new and untapped source of organizational insight, unstructured data analytics has the ability to uncover more critical interrelationships that were very difficult or impossible to establish before. Moreover, the ability to connect vast numbers of machines to a single network, known as cloud computing, that is also leads to presents IT professionals with several challenges. Some of the most contentious problems is who controls the data and whether the provider can maintain it. Distance communication is also matter, conventional offices become less important as digital technology such as e-mail, instant messaging and video conferencing allow workers to work remotely. Consequently, IT professionals are likely to encounter unprecedented pressure to maintain networks operating at the maximum capacity.</li>
