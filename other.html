	   <p><b><u>Individual Reflections</u></b></p>
	   
	   <p>Michael: I enjoyed working with the group, and we were fine working together. We kept in constant communication through MS Teams and everyone was more than happy to do their assigned tasks. From what I’ve seen, the work produced by each member is of considerably good quality, and everyone was happy to help others if they needed help. It was very surprising to me that everyone was doing work throughout the entirety of the project, rather than just leaving it till the last minute. In terms of what I’ve learned through work in a group, I think its really useful having other people to talk to, as you’re able to get advice / a second opinion, and also have the other people give me feedback on my work that I’ve produced. For our GitHub repository, when changes were made to our html files, they were uploaded, and the changes were committed straight away. This proved to be very useful as all we had to do was upload the html files from GitHub directly to AWS.</p>
	   <p>Joshua: I think that Ivan’s group making worked well because the team worked very well together. Everyone easily assigned each other their roles and was happy to do their part. I never had to remind my team to do their part as everyone kept a good schedule and kept on top of their workload. Everyone was able to work together and complete their parts of the assignment. It is good to be able to work in groups because then I am then able to get a second opinion and I can discuss the assignment. If someone in the team was having trouble with their part of the assignment the rest of the team helped them and we overcame any issues very quickly. I had never used GitHub before, so I wasn’t too sure how to use it very well, but while completing the assignment I have been learning how to use it. Everyone contributed to the GitHub repository, so I think that it does show well the groups worked. I think if we had more time I would have liked to have more Teams meetings so that we could discuss our progress more.</p>
	   <p>Chathura: to be done...</p>
	   <p>Kavishka: We did a very good group task because everyone in the group was in a constant communication via MS Teams. I could say the way of allocation group members to each section is very admirable. Each IT experts choose their professionalism towards their selected sections. Since the better time management, we could be able to accomplish this assignment before the deadline. Everyone helped each other when someone was struggling with his things to do. Contribution to the GitHub repository is well done because everyone has a better awareness of it.</p>
