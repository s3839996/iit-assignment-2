       <h2 id="yeet1"><b>GROUP REFLECTION</b></h2>
	   <p><b><u>Individual Reflections</u></b></p>
	   
	   <p><u>Michael:</u> I enjoyed working with the group, and we were fine working together. We kept in constant communication through MS Teams and everyone was more than happy to do their assigned tasks. From what I’ve seen, the work produced by each member is of considerably good quality, and everyone was happy to help others if they needed help. It was very surprising to me that everyone was doing work throughout the entirety of the project, rather than just leaving it till the last minute. In terms of what I’ve learned through work in a group, I think its really useful having other people to talk to, as you’re able to get advice / a second opinion, and also have the other people give me feedback on my work that I’ve produced. For our GitHub repository, when changes were made to our html files, they were uploaded, and the changes were committed straight away. This proved to be very useful as all we had to do was upload the html files from GitHub directly to AWS.</p>
	   <p><u>Joshua:</u> I think that Ivan’s group making worked well because the team worked very well together. Everyone easily assigned each other their roles and was happy to do their part. I never had to remind my team to do their part as everyone kept a good schedule and kept on top of their workload. Everyone was able to work together and complete their parts of the assignment. It is good to be able to work in groups because then I am then able to get a second opinion and I can discuss the assignment. If someone in the team was having trouble with their part of the assignment the rest of the team helped them and we overcame any issues very quickly. I had never used GitHub before, so I wasn’t too sure how to use it very well, but while completing the assignment I have been learning how to use it. Everyone contributed to the GitHub repository, so I think that it does show well the groups worked. I think if we had more time I would have liked to have more Teams meetings so that we could discuss our progress more.</p>
	   <p><u>Chathura:</u> TO BE DONE...</p>
	   <p><u>Kavishka:</u> We did a very good group task because everyone in the group was in a constant communication via MS Teams. I could say the way of allocation group members to each section is very admirable. Each IT experts choose their professionalism towards their selected sections. Since the better time management, we could be able to accomplish this assignment before the deadline. Everyone helped each other when someone was struggling with his things to do. Contribution to the GitHub repository is well done because everyone has a better awareness of it.</p>
	   
	   <p><b><u>Combined Reflection</u></b></p>
	   <p>Overall, as a group we feel like we worked extremely well together. Even though a lot of us have never actually met others in the group, and despite that we were automatically allocated to this, we still connected with each other quite well, and we had similar interests and hobbies. From the first session, we had gone straight to assigning individual tasks, and many of us happily volunteered to do the more time-consuming ones, like Chathura and Michael, who offered to work on the website development and most of IT Technologies. Josh produced some excellent work on the project idea (which was originally “thought out” by Chathura). Josh and Michael made frequent contributions to the Git repository (in which we uploaded the HTML files whenever there was a significant amount of changes), and Kavishka worked hard on the IT Work and part of the IT Technologies section. It would’ve been preferred if we could’ve had a bit more spare time before the due date, as we had submitted ours very close to deadline, but this was to ensure that our work was of the highest possible quality, and we were continually referring back to the rubric.  This proved very useful when reading over our work, and it also saved us from forgetting to add the ‘Feedback’ section to our website.</p>
	   <p>The group kept in constant communication on Microsoft Teams, and Josh made sure to keep recording our calls and attaching the links to GitHub. A good thing that we all thought about working in groups is the ability to ask for help from others, and not only that, but it's so easy to get a second opinion on work that you’ve done, and make possible improvements or fix errors. Some examples of this included very common punctuation and spelling errors, as well as errors in the html code (such as forgetting to close a tag).</p>
	   <p>So overall, the group worked very well, and we don’t mind the others in our group. We are keen for Assignment 3 and are more than happy to continue working in this current group.</p>
