                <h2><b><u>Health Issue Prediction Tool</u></b></h2>
                <p>As a group we decided that our project idea would be a health issue prediction tool. This tool would be a web-based application, with the potential of eventually being made into an application for mobile phones, such as iOS and Android. The web application would allow Australian’s to go online and predict any health issues they may have based off information they provide to the system. </p>

                <p>When users first access the website, they will be promoted to enter personal information such as their age, sex, and any past medical issues they have had. Users will then be asked if they optionally would like to enter more information. The more information the user enters the more accurate the predictions will be. Additional information they can enter could be ethnicity, diet, weight, any family illnesses, are they smokers, alcohol consumption, etc. </p>

                <p>After the user enters the information they have chosen to share, the system will analyse their information against existing medical conditions. For example, a user enters that they are in their 60s, have had a cough, nasal congestion and a headache. The system will look at these symptoms and determine what the most likely medical condition for this is. After giving the user the most likely medical condition, it will advise them on the next steps to take which could include taking cold medication and resting or seeing a doctor if it gets worse. </p>

                <p>Privacy and security will have to be a major part of this system as it would store and manage highly confidential information. To ensure the privacy of users the system would allow users to get health predictions without having to create an account or entering any identifying information such as name, address, Medicare number, etc. After a user gets their personal information/symptoms analysed, users could optionally choose to create an account in order to store their information that they have entered. By giving users the ability to store their personal information they would be saving time the next time they needed to use the system as they would not have to re-enter all of their personal information, instead they would only have to log in and enter their new symptoms. </p>

                <p>The system could be useful in reducing the stress on the public health system. By using this online system Australian’s would not have to visit their general practitioner as often, therefore saving funds and resources for other Australian’s with serious health issues. The stress on the public health system is more apparent now than ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic as many Australian’s are going to their general practitioner to diagnose symptoms they have, which could be just the common cold. Instead of going to their general practitioner, Australian’s would have the ability to answer questions to determine if they actually need to go to their general practitioner.</p>

                <p>CSIRO researchers stated that by helping the ill monitor and manage their conditions at home instead of going to their general practitioner or hospital they could ‘save the health budget up to $3 billion a year’. Another article published by Roy Morgan states that ‘11.3% of Australians (14+) looked up health or medical information online’, suggesting that many Australian’s already prefer looking online for medical advice. Therefore, having a reliable system which would be built with the input of professional doctors’ people would be able to get reliable information, unlike many other websites where people can simply enter what they believe, without any medical information to back their claims. </p>
